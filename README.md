# Introduction to Bootstrap Demo

This project is designed for learners who are using Bootstrap for the first time and is a compliment to my coding demo; however, if you want to learn Bootstrap by jumping right in with a simple project, this is for you!  All you need is a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

The real key to learning and using Bootstrap is navigating the documentation, and so that is the focus of this project.

Here is a wireframe to get you started:

## Setup
* Create a new folder for your project called `bootstrap-app` with a new file called `index.html`
* Open your new folder in VS Code
* Open the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for reference

## Steps 
1. In `index.html`, create a boilerplate html page (hint: use emmet shortcut)
2. In between the `<body>` tags, add an `<h1>` with some example text
3. Start up Live Server in VS Code, and confirm that the example header is displayed
4. Find the Getting Started section in the documentation, and copy/paste the Bootstrap `<link>` and `<script>` elements into your `index.html`
5. In the navbar section of the documentation, copy/paste the code for a navbar with brand, links, and search bar to match the wireframe
6. Search in the documentation for the sections on text and margins, and adjust the position of the `<h1>` element using Bootstrap classes
7. Create a `<section>` element under the `<h1>`
8. Inside the new section, copy/paste 3 card components from the documentation that include all the same elements in the wireframe
9. Add a url to an image for each card (You can use https://placehold.co/) 
10. Review the section on flexbox styles in the docs, and apply flex to your section element to position the cards like the wireframe (you can use classes for flex, margin, gap, and padding to accomplish this)
11. Create a new `<section>` element below our card section for our hero
12. Go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/heroes/ and use the browser's dev tools to inspect the last hero to see what elements and classes were used 
13. Create an `<h2>`, `<p>`, and a `<div>` to hold the two buttons (Use VS Code or a [lorem ipsum generator](https://loremipsum.io/) to create filler text for the `<p>`)
14. Go back to the documentation on button components, and copy/paste 2 outline buttons in different colors within the `<div>`
15. Use the classes from the example in step 12 to style the elements in the hero
16. What else can you do?  Explore different components and utilities!
